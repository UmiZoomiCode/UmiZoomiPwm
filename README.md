# UmiZoomiPwm
A motor control tool for raspberry pi arduino hardware combinations.

Current components:
PWM ouput loop for Arduino Nano
Serial communication code between Raspberry Pi and Arduino
PS3 controller intergration with RPI and onto Aruduino though the serial connection

BACKGROUND: I wanted to control my electric skateboard with something a little more discrete. Namely a PS3 one handed controller. 
The system can be extended to utilize any arbitrary input device and translate that into serial communication with the Arduino.
